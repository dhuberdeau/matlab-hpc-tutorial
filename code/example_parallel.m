%%%     - 2018-06-13: Mention use of an offline data source, in case Google

% Set company ticker, e.g. 'AAPL' for Apple
company_ticker = 'AAPL';

% Use the external function to download Google finance data for the selected period
% Change this to [...] = file_data_source('AAPL') if the google_finance_data returns an error
[hist_date, hist_high, hist_low, hist_open, hist_close, hist_vol] = file_data_source(company_ticker);

% Convert string dates for plotting
dates = datenum(hist_date);

% 2D Plot: dates on X axis and closing prices on Y axis
f = figure('visible','off');
plot(dates, hist_close);

% Set format for X axis tickers and labels/titles
dateaxis('x', 17);
xlabel('Date');
ylabel('Price (USD)');
title(sprintf('Closing stock prices for %s between %s and %s ', company_ticker, hist_date(1), hist_date(end)));

% Save plot to PDF
saveas(f, 'example1-2dplot.pdf');

% Also save plot to black and white EPS, with 300 DPI
dateaxis('x', 6);
print(f, '-deps', '-r300', 'example1-2dplot.eps');

% 3D Scatter plot: dates on X axis, closing prices on Y axis, volume of shares on Z axis
% Furthermore, print in a different color datapoints where the closing
% share price was above 100 (hm, in 2014 I did the split at 500..)
f = figure('visible','off');
scatter3(dates, hist_close, hist_vol, [] , hist_close > 100);

% Set format for X axis tickers and labels/titles
dateaxis('x', 17);
xlabel('Date');
ylabel('Price (USD)');
zlabel('Trading volume');
title(sprintf('Closing stock prices and trading volumes for %s between %s and %s ', company_ticker, hist_date(1), hist_date(end)));

% Save plot to color EPS, with 300 DPI
print(f, '-depsc', '-r300', 'example1-scatter.eps');
